Here, we will discuss the following topics:

- [Kafka Architecture](#kafka-architecture)
- [Kafka Components](#kafka-components)
- [Kafka Topics](#kafka-topics)
- [Kafka Producers](#kafka-producers)
- [Kafka Consumers](#kafka-consumers)
- [Kafka Brokers](#kafka-brokers)
- [Kafka Zookeeper](#kafka-zookeeper)
- [Kafka Cluster](#kafka-cluster)
- [Kafka Manager](#kafka-manager)
- [Confluentic Schema Registry](#confluent-schema-registry)
- [Kafka Topics UI](#kafka-topics-ui)

## Kafka Architecture

Our finished architecture will look like this:
